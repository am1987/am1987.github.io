# Aim and scope

The Workshop on Distributed Ledger Technologies in Business Process Management (DLT4BPM) invites submissions of papers on techniques for and applications of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), including blockchains and related approaches. We invite contributions of conceptual, technical, and application-oriented nature both from inside and outside the BPM community. We welcome submissions from students, researchers, and industry practitioners alike. Works showing relevance for contemporary organizations (governmental bodies or enterprises) and domains (from healthcare to education, from finance to logistics, etc.) are welcome.

DLT systems open up diverse opportunities in the context of the BPM lifecycle to redesign business activities in a wide range of fields, including healthcare, supply chain, logistics, and finance. However, these opportunities come with challenges related to security, privacy, scalability, and performance.

DLT has already seen both academic interest and practical adoption, and several approaches combine BPM and DLT, e.g., conceptual modeling for DLT and BPM, collaborative business process execution on DLT, process monitoring and auditing on data stored by distributed ledgers, secrecy-preserving sharing of data among actors in a multi-party process setting, the use of process mining to analyze and validate smart contracts, and many more.

The DLT4BPM workshop serves as a platform for discussing and introducing new research ideas in DLT and their applications. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to, the following:

**Foundations**
* Formal verification of DLT-based processes
* Conceptual modeling for DLT and BPM
* Domain-specific modeling languages for DLT and BPM
* Taxonomies, ontologies and design patterns for DLT and BPM
* Identification of novel problems and  research gaps
* Vision papers on the future of DLT and BPM

**Engineering**
* Design of DLT-based process-aware information systems (PaIS)
* Model-driven engineering solutions for DLT and BPM
* Automatic code generation for DLT systems supporting BPM
* Requirement engineering for DLT and BPM
* On-chain and off-chain process execution and enactment
* Scalable models for DLT-based process execution
* Interoperability and cross-chain processes 
* Oracles, off-chain and cross-chain information exchange for decision support
* Distributed process monitoring, predictive models and anomaly detection
* Distributed compliance monitoring and auditing
* On-chain and off-chain data analytics and process mining
* Self-sovereign identity solutions for DLT and BPM
* Security and resilience requirements for DLT
* Privacy, confidentiality, and access control for DLT-based solutions
* Zero-knowledge proof techniques for process execution
* LLM and ML for BPM on DLT

**Management**
* Organizational and governance models for DLT and BPM
* Enforcement of regulations and business rules with DLTs
* Empirical case studies on the usage of DLTs in BPM
* Experience report on the use & adoption of DLTs in businesses
* Authentication and identity management in DLT and BPM
* Data provenance and management in DLT and BPM
* Regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR, KYC, AML) and legal aspects of DLT-based PaIS
* Economic and environmental sustainability of DLT-based PaIS
* Vertical applications of DLT-based PaIS (e.g., healthcare, supply chain, finance, logistics)

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
